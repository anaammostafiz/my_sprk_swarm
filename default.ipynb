In a warehouse where items need to be retrieved and restocked, a swarm of robots can engage in collective decision-making to optimize the overall efficiency.

If you are interested in using a Sphero robot for yourself, you can schedule an in-person visit the IgnitED Labs at Arizona State University through our website: https://ignitedlabs.education.asu.edu/. While there are currently connection issues with the actual Sphero swarm, you can bring some friends to each control a Sphero and create your own swarm behaviors, using the Sphero obstacles and playsets available.
